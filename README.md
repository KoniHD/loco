# LOCO: Logistics Objects in Context

LOCO is the first scene understanding dataset for logistics covering the problem of detecting logistics-specific objects. Images are captured while walking through a logistics setting using low-cost cameras. We currently provide 37,988 images captured in 5 logistics environments, of which 5593 images are manually annotated, resulting in 152,421 annotations. Annotated classes include forklifts, pallet trucks, pallets, small load carriers and stillages.

## Dataset
### Data
The annotated dataset can be downloaded [here](https://syncandshare.lrz.de/dl/fiLs87iyphDhmTKh7Xb347sG/dataset.zip). Furthermore, we also provide additional data (not annotated) [here](https://syncandshare.lrz.de/dl/fiqZVRQHJFtmkDx8ghhCBM9/not-annotated-dataset).
### Annotations 
Annotations are stored in [COCO format](https://cocodataset.org/#format-data) under `rgb/loco-all-v1.json`. For ease of use, we also provide seperate annotation files for each subset.
